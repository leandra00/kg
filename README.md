# H1 Challenge solution
Using a python script:
1. Iterate over the api pages to find all the air conditioners.
2. Calculate the total cubic weight for the air conditioners.
3. Divide by the number of air conditioners found.

# H1 Installation/Setup instructions
If you're using osx or a linux based system and have python3 installed:
```
> python3 cubic-weight.py
```

If you're using osx or a linux based system and have docker installed:
```
> docker build -t cubic-weight .
> docker run cubic-weight
```

If you're using an unspecified system, we'd need to chat.

If you're using windows... don't use windows. :p

# H1 Expected output
A console message stating the average cubic weight. Eg:
```
'Average cubic weight is: 41.61kg'
```
